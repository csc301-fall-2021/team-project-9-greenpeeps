 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.

 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Wednesday, October 27th, 2021 from 9pm to 10pm
 * Where: Online Zoom Meeting

## Process - Reflection


### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

**List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.**


*2 - 4 decisions.*
*Ordered from most to least important.*
*Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.*
*Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).*

- We have had different text channels and threads in our discord server to organize communication and ensure everything is easy to find. For instance, we have a channel for links which includes links such as a link to the Github, the figma, and packages. 
- We split up into sub-teams for every main feature. Almost evenly split between login, initial questionnaire, and carbon emissions.
- We forced branching by disallowing pushing to the main branch.
- We have a shared google drive which contains our many documents for this project including deliverable 1 draft, deliverable 2, an agenda for what we will discuss in our partner meetings, and features.
- We set soft integration deadlines to ensure that people start thinking about the code well before the deadline so even if that deadline is missed it is not a big deal.
- Having a when2meet and also knowing everyone’s schedules was helpful in planning meetings, and knowing availability. 

### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

**List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.**

*2 - 4 decisions.*
*Ordered from most to least important.*
*Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful*
*Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).*

- Because we were split into different groups, different parts of the structure of the database were completed at different times so coordinating between the different parts was difficult.
- There was miscommunication between the group and the partner which led to the partner being late to meetings. 
- Sometimes it was hard to know if everyone had read a message, which created uncertainty as to whether everyone is on the same page. 





### Q3. Planned changes

**List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)**

*Ordered from most to least important.*
*Explain why you are making a change.*

- Start using trello to keep track of the features we need to implement and are in progress.
- We will acknowledge announcements on discord, so the announcement maker knows everyone is on the same page. 
- We will engage in team building to boost morale. 
- As a fail safe so everyone can make it to meetings, we now have our partner’s phone number for quick communication in case of technical issues. 



## Product - Review

### Q4. How was your product demo?
- How did you prepare your demo?
  - We set a deadline to have most features done before our meeting with our partner. We also had a meeting an hour before the meeting to make sure merging code goes smoothly and discuss the order that each subteam presents.
- What did you manage to demo to your partner?
  - We took our partner through our project. We started with the login page and showed him how to register an account. Then we went through the initial questionnaire which leads to the homepage which shows a user’s carbon emissions. Finally, we demonstrated logging into the database (would not work for faulty emails and passwords).
- Did your partner accept the features?
  - Yes, even offered to restructure his documents to match our firebase collections, as well as learn more leading to webpages.
- Were there change requests?
  - Will update us with more categories Food Wastage, International Travel, etc.
  - Change colours, specifically pie chart diagrams too (ex. Colours that match the categories (ex. Lightning and yellow)).
  - Proper list of questions and impacts.
  - Signing in with Facebook, Google, and Apple 
- What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
  - We learnt to merge code much earlier before the demo in case we run into any complications.
  - To do a test demo before the real demo (because we invoked a bug).
